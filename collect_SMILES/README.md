Transfer siderophore names into SMILES by [ChemSider](https://www.chemspider.com/) API and [Chemical Indentifier Resolver](https://cactus.nci.nih.gov/chemical/structure).

However, only part of siderophores can be obtained by these ways.

Usage:
```
python Compandname2SMILES_by_ChemSpider.py
python Compandname2SMILES_by_Chemical_Identifier_Resolver.py
```
